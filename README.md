# IU-Reinforcement-Learning-22-lab

## Week01 - Introduction [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zDJJXJnqGhrO90KshPkGmZeW7K0Nt_Nd?usp=sharing)

By the end of this lab you are expected to:

- Have a quick review for the **lecture 01**.
- Understand the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning and learn to test your algorithms with OpenAI gym.
- Training your first reinforcement learning model using stable-baselines3 , evaluate, test, use callbacks and learn how to save and load the RL models.

## Week02 - Exploration and exploitation [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RorA11Fxjy27GPWzXDjQTecJzdPf9Rub?usp=sharing)
In this lab you will implement several exploration strategies for simplest problem - bernoulli bandit.

## Week03 - Markov Decision Process [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14WoNN2awvPJfzJQmEB-xVMv8oDy-TJeA?usp=sharing)

By the end of this lab you will understand how Markov Reward Process and Markov Decision Process work. Also you will apply the direct solution to find the optimal policy.

## Week04 - Dynamic Programming [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1t2y5UXvHNhCVZIb9AIgcVeUqS4DAkXlE?usp=sharing)
Policy Iteration and Value Iteration algorithms
